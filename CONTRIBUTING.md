## Commit Guidelines

We follow semantic commits to keep the project history clear and generate automated changelogs. Please format your commit messages as follows:

### Types
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **content**: Updates to method content
- **feat**: Adding new method sections or major concepts
- **fix**: Correcting errors in existing content
- **style**: Formatting, missing images, etc. (no content change)
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, file organization, etc.

### Scope (Optional)
The scope provides context about what part of the methodology is being modified:
- **core**: Core principles
- **planning**: Planning horizons
- **roles**: Roles and responsibilities
- **examples**: Implementation examples
- **assets**: Images and diagrams

### Examples
